          Ogulcan is a very quick learner and quickly grasps key concepts of Web development. 
          He is always pushing his limits and always trying to be perfect.
          His dialog with the people around him is very good, if he was part of a team, he would influence that team with his positivity
          <span>&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
          The language he uses in communication makes him a team player.
          If he disagrees with your opinion, he conveys it in such a way that you never sense any negativity. 
          <span>&#8221;</span>
        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
          During the course, he did not skip any lessons and did the tasks assigned to him to the letter.
          It was a very pleasant experience to put him in the sea and watch him learn to swim.
          I am sure that when Ogulcan reaches his potential, he will help the people around him reach theirs.
